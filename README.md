# Asumsi Frontend Coding Test

## Assignment

For this assignment, you are supposed to build a CRUD-complete **to-do list**, persisted on the user's machine, no external database needed.

### Stack

We are using [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as our frontend stack and you are required to use the same stack for this assignment.

### Layouting the app

Don't waste your time on making a beautiful visual. When you're doing the real work at Asumsi, it will be handed out to you.

### Must have

- [ ] Assign priority to a TO-DO and sort them by **highest to lowest priority**;
- [ ] Set a due time. Add real-time visual and auditive hints to the TO-DO item that indicate that the due time is near and has passed;
- [x] Nice usability;
- [ ] Nice stylesheet and a nice layout out of it;
- [x] Work on Chrome.

### Nice to have

- [ ] Unit tests;
- [ ] Acceptance tests.

## Instructions

Create a new repo on your favorite git platform (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.), copy this README into it and as you progress with the assignment, check the boxes above.

**After you've finished, you can share the repository URL with us (preferred) or, if you made it on a private repository, just send us a .zip containing the source code.**

## Review

After you delivered the completed assignment to us, we will review it as soon as we can, generally within 3 days. **We pay special attention to:**

- Coding skills
  - Writing testable code
  - Whether you use React, HTML and CSS properly
- Software Engineering Skills
  - Code organization (modularity, dependencies between modules, naming, etc)
- Overall Feeling
  - Software usability
  - Assignment completion
  - Overall code quality (edge cases, usage of tools, performance, best practices)

## Presentation

If we like what we see, we'll ask you to demo your solution!

## Hints

- Don't need to re-invent the wheel, for components like date picker and/or time picker you can use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) or any other components of your choice.
- Try to rely as little as possible on 3rd party tools.
- As a company, we believe that communication is the key to success. So if something is not clear to you, or if you have doubts on what you can use, reach the developers.
- Treat this project as if you/we would continue working on this after your assignment: maintainability, scalability, and readability are super important.
